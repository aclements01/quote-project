          This is an annotated archive of excerpts from books I read in graduate
          school.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The selections drift through memory, death, poetry, and esoteric
          thought, mapping the tension between longing and resignation, knowing
          and believing. These are not just quotes; they are echoes of restless
          minds contemplating the impermanence of things.
